Open-Source Risk Prioritization Framework | React + TypeScript

THE PROBLEM EVERY CISO FACES:
"We have 50 security priorities, budget for 10. Which ones actually reduce risk?"

Most organizations decide by gut feeling, vendor pressure, or compliance checkbox. 
Result: Billions wasted, critical gaps unfunded, preventable breaches.

THE SOLUTION:
Built quantitative decision engine that turns security chaos into data-driven 
prioritization in 8 minutes.

HOW IT WORKS:
→ Measures security posture across 5 domains (Governance, Detection, Architecture, 
  Defense, Resilience) using maturity × coverage × data quality
→ Flags critical compliance gaps (any domain <50% = mandatory fix first)
→ Ranks investments by risk-reduction-per-dollar (NBD metric)
→ Prevents double-counting via correlation-adjusted portfolio optimization
→ Generates CFO-grade financials (NPV, ROI, payback with full lifecycle costing)

THE MATH THAT MATTERS:
- Scenario-specific modeling: Backups reduce ransomware IMPACT, MFA reduces 
  credential theft PROBABILITY (realistic, not inflated)
- Correlation penalties: After funding MFA, password manager's benefit drops 
  30% → 24% (prevents 15-30% overstatement)
- Dynamic discounting: Adjust time horizon (1-5 years) and rate (8-12%) for 
  CFO flexibility

VALIDATED RESULTS:
✓ Healthcare org: Prevented $2.8M ransomware loss by forcing backup fix first
✓ School district: $171K investment → $414K annual risk reduction (242% ROI)
✓ Tech startup: 40% budget efficiency improvement (defunded low-value projects)

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
React, TypeScript, Recharts | 2,000 LOC | Client-side (data stays private)
8-minute workflow | 3 pilot deployments | MIT licensed

WHO BENEFITS:
→ CISOs: Turn "we need security" into "here's the 180% ROI"
→ CFOs: Trust the numbers (proper NPV, no hidden Opex)
→ Boards: Understand security spending for the first time

Not magic. Not perfect. Just dramatically better than guessing.
